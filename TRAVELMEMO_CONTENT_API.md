# Travelmemo Content API

A standalone WordPress plugin for blog content extraction that bypasses Cloudflare bot protection.

## Clean Architecture

```
/wp-json/travelmemo-schema/v1/    â†’ Your Schema.org project (unchanged)
/wp-json/travelmemo-content/v1/   â†’ New standalone content API
```

**Why Standalone?**
- âœ… Clean separation from Schema.org project
- âœ… Independent versioning and updates
- âœ… Focused functionality (content extraction only)
- âœ… Easy maintenance and debugging

        ],

## Installation

**Simple Plugin Installation:**
1. Upload `travelmemo-content-api.php` to `/wp-content/plugins/travelmemo-content-api/`
2. Activate "Travelmemo Content API" in WordPress Admin â†’ Plugins
3. Test endpoint: `https://travelmemo.com/wp-json/travelmemo-content/v1/extract/sardinia-east-coast-beaches`

**Verification:**
- Visit: `https://travelmemo.com/wp-json/` (should show the new namespace)
- Test with actual post slug and auth key

## Benefits of Separate Namespace

### âœ… Clean Organization
- **Schema API**: Focused on Schema.org management
- **Content API**: Dedicated to content extraction
- **Independent**: Each API can evolve separately

### âœ… Better Maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent versioning
- Easier debugging and updates

### âœ… Cloudflare Bypass
- Uses dedicated API path not recognized as WordPress core
- Custom User-Agent: `TravelMemo-ContentFetcher/1.0`
- No complex authentication headers

## Integration with Automation

Your automation now uses:

1. **Travelmemo Content API** (primary) - `/wp-json/travelmemo-content/v1/extract/{slug}`
2. **Standard WordPress API** (fallback) - `/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?slug={slug}`
3. **Direct Page Scraping** (final fallback) - Full page extraction
