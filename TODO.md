# TODO - Reisememo Workflow Testing Continuation

## Current Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION:**
- Reisememo multi-account support successfully merged to main branch
- GitHub Actions workflow for Reisememo deployed and available 
- Windows Unicode logging issues resolved
- Environment template (.env.example) created
- Workflow triggered and tested - progressed to GitHub API authentication step

## üîß IMMEDIATE TASKS FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Fix GitHub Token Authentication (HIGH PRIORITY)
‚óè The Issue: Both workflows reference GITHUB_TOKEN but you only have PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN in secrets.

  What I Fixed: Updated both workflow files to use ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} instead of ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN }}.

  What You Need To Do:
  1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
  2. Add a new secret called GITHUB_TOKEN
  3. Use the same Personal Access Token value from your existing PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN

  Once you add the GITHUB_TOKEN secret, both accounts will work with the same token as intended.

### 2. Complete Reisememo Workflow Testing
**Once GitHub token is fixed:**
- [ ] Re-run Reisememo workflow with dry-run enabled
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Test Flickr API connection for Reisememo album
- [ ] Test Instagram API connection for Reisememo account
- [ ] Verify AI caption generation works
- [ ] Confirm dry-run simulation completes successfully

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Reisememo workflow test should show:**
- ‚úÖ All environment variables validated
- ‚úÖ GitHub API connection successful  
- ‚úÖ Flickr API connection successful
- ‚úÖ Instagram API connection successful
- ‚úÖ AI caption generation working
- ‚úÖ Dry run simulation completed
- ‚úÖ No errors in workflow logs

## üìã TESTING COMMANDS FOR REFERENCE

**Local Testing (if needed):**
```bash
# Test Reisememo account locally (after setting up .env)
python main.py --dry-run --account reisememo

# Show Reisememo statistics  
python main.py --stats --account reisememo
```

**GitHub Actions Testing:**
1. Actions tab ‚Üí "Flickr to Instagram Automation - Reisememo"
2. Run workflow ‚Üí Check "Run without posting (dry run)" ‚Üí Run workflow
3. Monitor logs for detailed execution steps

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING NOTES

**If workflow still fails after token fix:**
- Check repository Variables section for missing Reisememo-specific variables
- Verify Instagram account ID format (should be numeric business account ID)
- Check Flickr album ID exists and is accessible
- Review workflow logs step-by-step for specific error messages

## ‚ú® NEXT MILESTONE

Once Reisememo workflow testing is complete:
- Enable scheduled automation (currently runs at 09:13 UTC daily)
- Monitor first live posts from Reisememo account
- Set up monitoring/alerts for both primary and Reisememo workflows
